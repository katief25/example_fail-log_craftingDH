Week starting off well, I'm understanding the readings and have a good idea of the content
Open source notebooks seems like a useful and efficient way for everyone to have access to new information that they may be interested, or provide research that they've been doing to help others out

# Exercise 1 - 
Starting off rough
I do not understand what I am supposed to do for the Creative Common images, and what 4 links I am supposed to provide
Hoping this becomes more clear soon
I'm trying to link the images, and it isn't working. I've tried multiple urls and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong at this point.  
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/AS7n4nnTEemU2gfqui8b5g/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/), that helped me out a lot this week was when I asked for help with this exercise. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do, and thankfully a classmate responded and helped me out. After getting a response, I was able to move forward with the assignment.
Thankfully, I finished up this exercise after coming back to it awhile later. 
  
# Exercise 2 - 
This one has gone well, I got through this exercise will very few problems
This one looked a bit more itimidating with all the coding, but much to my surprise, it went well
  
# Exercise 3 - 
This one also went well thankfully
I'm not sure that I did everything completely right, but I think that I got most of it
  
# Exercise 4 - 
Definitely more difficult
This one got me stumped. I got through the first couple (4.1 and 4.2) but once I got to 4.3 I got lost. I'll come back and try to       reattempt what I started. 
After some time away from the computer, I came back to try and continue with 4.3. I'm not sure if I did something wrong in 4.1 and 4.2 but now 4.3 seems harder. I was able to get past a couple of steps the first time I tried it, but now I'm not able to. 

# Second Annotation
The [second annotation](https://hyp.is/MkD-AHjBEemLAM-UQMBl7w/ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/) was interesting, because I had the same thoughts when reading this part of the article. The idea of open access research is not a one way street where only others are benefitting from your work, because you could also benefit from theres. An interesting and important piece to keep in mind. 

# Third Annotation
The [third annotation](https://hyp.is/_-GG8ngjEemqGBfxFC-KsA/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) made me realize how much we take for granted. We need to appreciate the work and research that is being shared, and recognize that it isn't just an hours worth of work being provided, but rather perhaps someones profession that they are sharing. An interesting point, that I wouldn't have thought about by myself.
