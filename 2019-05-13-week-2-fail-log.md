Week starting off well, I'm understanding the readings and have a good idea of the content
Open source notebooks seems like a useful and efficient way for everyone to have access to new information that they may be interested, or provide research that they've been doing to help others out
# Exercise 1 - 
Starting off rough
I do not understand what I am supposed to do for the Creative Common images, and what 4 links I am supposed to provide
Hoping this becomes more clear soon
I'm trying to link the images, and it isn't working. I've tried multiple urls and I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong at this point.  
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/AS7n4nnTEemU2gfqui8b5g/workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/module-1/Exercises/), that helped me out a lot this week was when I asked for help with this exercise. I wasn't sure what I was supposed to do, and thankfully a classmate responded and helped me out. After getting a response, I was able to move forward with the assignment.  
  
# Exercise 2 - 
This one has gone well, I got through this exercise will very few problems
This one looked a bit more itimidating with all the coding, but much to my surprise, it went well
  
# Exercise 3 - 
This one also went well thankfully
I'm not sure that I did everything completely right, but I think that I got most of it
  
# Exercise 4 - 
Definitely more difficult
This one got me stumped. I got through the first couple (4.1 and 4.2) but once I got to 4.3 I got lost. I'll come back and try to       reattempt what I started. 
After some time away from the computer, I came back to try and continue with 4.3. I'm not sure if I did something wrong in 4.1 and 4.2 but now 4.3 seems harder. I was able to get past a couple of steps the first time I tried it, but now I'm not able to.
