Week starting off well, I'm understanding the readings and have a good idea of the content
Open source notebooks seems like a useful and efficient way for everyone to have access to new information that they may be interested, or provide research that they've been doing to help others out
# Exercise 1 - starting off rough
  I do not understand what I am supposed to do for the Creative Common images, and what 4 links I am supposed to provide
  Hoping this becomes more clear soon
  
# Exercise 2 - This one has gone well, I got through this exercise will very few problems
  This one looked a bit more itimidating with all the coding, but much to my surprise, it went well
  
# Exercise 3 - This one also went well thankfully
  I'm not sure that I did everything completely right, but I think that I got most of it
  
# Exercuse 4 - Definitely more difficult
  This one got me stumped. I got through the first couple (4.1 and 4.2) but once I got to 4.3 I got lost. I'll come back and try to       reattempt what I started.
