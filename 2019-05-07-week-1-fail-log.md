# Week 1 fail log
This week was definitely a bit stressful for me. I felt somewhat overwhelmed with the class, and was unsure with what I was supposed to be doing. Thankfully, I feel that things have picked up a bit and I'm beginning to get a grasp of what to do.    

## First Annotation
My [first annotation](workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) discusses one of the first frusturations I ran into. As I was attempting to follow the instructions for 'forking' the example fail log, I kept getting annoyed at myself for not being able to figure out things that seem like they should be basic. I kept getting stuck on how to change the title and make it my own. After attempting different things, taking a few breaks and coming back to it, I figured out how to do it, which was a win in my books. 
The biggest thing this taught me, and I feel it will be important going forward in the course, is that not everything will come easily, or right away. Sometimes it takes some time away from the screen, and a fresh mind to re-attempt the task.

## Second Annotation
My [second annotation](workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) is about the DH Box. I read through the description multiple times, however I still feel confused about what it will be used for and how to work it. It is somewhat intimidating to know that I'll have use and figure out this website, however, I know it can be done, I just need to have the right mindset and be willing to make mistakes along the way. 
I am definitley the type of person who likes to know what is going on, and I don't like to make mistakes. However, being an athlete I can relate my struggles that I'm experiencing in this course, to other things in my life. Most things take practice, and the only way to get better is to keep on practicing, so my goal with this course is to try and not let myself get frusturated, but rather keep working through the task and hopefully I'll get it. 

## Third Annotation
My [third annotation](workbook.craftingdigitalhistory.ca/introduction/crafting-digital-history/) was probably the most successful thing for me this week which was exciting! Setting up hypothes.is went really smoothly for me, and I caught on right away. I used the tool mutiple times and I have found it extremely useful so far. Rather than having to have a word document up, alongside the chrome browser, this tool is great because it collects all my notes and thoughts in one spot without having to have extra applications open.
After some difficulty trying to determine what the course was all about and what was required of me, setting up this account without any issues was relieving and gave me some hope for what was to come. 

## Comments/Concerns

Overall, I think the week went better than I expected when I first got started. After carefully reading through the Getting Started module, I started to get a hang of what to do. It was extremely daunting at first, and I never thought I would get through it, but thankfully I did. 

I am hoping that in the upcoming weeks I work on taking things step by step, and with the videos that are provided, I think it can be done!
