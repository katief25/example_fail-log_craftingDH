# Interesting Annotation
## My Thoughts
While doing the readings, and coming across annotations from my classmates, there were definitely interesting thoughts and opinions. However, a specfic annotation that stood out to me was in [Trevor Owens article](https://hyp.is/dJ_mIHdzEemC6WuXxDLv0w/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/). This annotation is interesting because it not only relates to history and the class, but I also think that the majority of us can actually **relate** to what is being said. Being students, there is often a lot of pressure placed upon us when writing papers or doing assignments, so reading about transparency in writing is a farily common notion. When we use work, it must be properly cited and referenced to. As the annotation mentions, finding current work is often a suggestion by professors, but thinking about the way students lives would change if this transparency was consistent for historic journals. This annotation in particular struck me, because not only did I immediately understand and relate to what was being said, but it also is a very real and possible change. It is not something that is farfetched and unlikely to ever happen.     
This annotation, although quite simple, demonstrates just how beneficial it could be to implement such transparency into the standard practice of these professionals. It would provide more opportunity for newer and younger individuals coming in, but it would also help for those to build on the work that they have done and create stronger research platforms. As mentioned, the overall impact of this implementation could allow for my efficient work to be done, because the amount of time trying to find all the research and sources would me greatly reduced as a result of everyone helping eachother out.

#### Research

This image represents the way in which research can come from all different areas and backgrounds, but it is interconnected, and can be used by others from different fields. By working together, and making research available online, we can bring the ideas together and form a community. 

#### Community

This image represents the way that having open source notebook research can create a community of people, who are interested in similar things, to come together and help one another out. 

### Links

#### Link #1
The [first link](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1607282) relates to sharing data and research. By providing research to others, we will be able to strengthen the field, and create more transparency. 
#### Link #2
The [second link](https://www.enago.com/academy/impact-data-sharing/) discusses again, how successful sharing data can be to everyone. By sharing with eachother we can accelerate the research in the field, and all move forward together, rather than wasting time on things that have already been researched and have answers. 
#### Link #3
The [third link](https://www.trentu.ca/community-based-research/) stood out to me, based around community research. I noticed alot of universities taking a larger part in having community based research, because people are beginning to realize the overall benefits that it can have. 
#### Link #4
The [fourth link](http://www.sfu.ca/northern-studies/GuidetoResearchInNWT.pdf) was an interesting one, because it also discusses the role of community partners in performing and gaining insight. By working **within** the community, as well as by working together **as** a community, there can be huge developments that encourage one another to continue research.
